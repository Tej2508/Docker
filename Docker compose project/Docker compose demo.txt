					Docker compose demo

Certainly! Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to create a complete end-to-end Docker Compose setup for your PHP application with a MySQL database, including all necessary files and configurations.

Step 1: Directory Structure
Create a new directory for your project:

my-php-app/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── index.html (or the name you prefer)
├── submit_details.php

Step 2: Create the HTML Form
index.html (or form.html)

Step 3: Create the PHP Submission Script
submit_details.php

Here's the PHP code for handling form submissions and inserting data into the MySQL database:

Step 4: Create the Dockerfile
Dockerfile

This file defines the Docker image for your PHP application:

Step 5: Create the Docker Compose Configuration
docker-compose.yml

This file orchestrates the PHP application and the MySQL database:

Step 6: Build and Run the Application
Navigate to your project directory and run:

docker-compose up --build -d


This command builds the images and starts the containers.

Step 7: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080. You should see the user details form.

Step 8: Submitting Data
Fill out the form and submit it. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a success message, and the data should be inserted into the MySQL database.

Step 9: Stopping the Application
To stop the containers and remove them, use:


docker-compose down


Assessing the database : docker exec -it <mysql_container_id> mysql -u admin -p
