Step 1: Set Up Your Application
Create a Simple Application
Create a directory for your project and navigate to it:

mkdir myapp
cd myapp

vi index.html  --> insert the application html code
vi dockerfile  --> this  is the associate dockerfile


Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in the same directory:

Step 3: Build the Docker Image
Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

docker build -t myapp .
This command builds the Docker image and tags it as myapp.

Step 4: Run the Docker Container

docker run -d -p 80:80 myapp

docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3001 <image Id>

This command runs your application in the background and maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.

Step 5: Access the Application
Open a web browser and go to:

http://localhost

eg- 10.10.89.33:80

You should see output 

Step 6: Manage Your Docker Container
to view the images
docker images

To view running containers:
docker ps

To stop the container:
docker stop <container_id>

To remove the container:
docker rm <container_id>

Optional: Clean Up
Remove the Docker image (if needed):
docker rmi <image id>

This process gives you a complete workflow for creating, building, and running a simple Dockerized application on port 80. Adjust the code and configurations as necessary for your specific application.


Docker Hub

# Log in to Docker Hub
docker login -u <user_name> (teju2508)
password:<Teju@2001>

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:tag .

# Push the image to Docker Hub
docker push your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:tag

# Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:tag

# Run the pulled image
docker run -d -p 80:80 your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:tag
